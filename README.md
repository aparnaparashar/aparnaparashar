## Hello!!!!ðŸ‘‹

I am Aparna, a pre-final year student at IGDTUW.âœ¨âœ¨

This space serves as a curated showcase of my technical journey where I explore modular design, edge case analysis, and data-driven problem solving. From building spam detection systems and cancer classification models to designing solar-powered IoT solutions and AI pipelines for biodiversity, I approach each project with clarity, precision, and a commitment to ethical impact.

Here you'll find clean documentation, structured workflows, and a touch of storytelling woven into the code. Whether you're here to collaborate, explore, or just peek into my process. I'm glad you stopped byðŸ˜Š.
